# Weather Dashboard

An elegant and feature-rich weather dashboard that provides comprehensive weather information through an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Project Description

This weather dashboard aggregates data from multiple weather APIs to provide users with accurate, up-to-date weather information. The application features a clean, responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

## Core Features

### Current Weather Display
- **Real-time Conditions**: Current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure
- **Weather Icons**: Dynamic icons that reflect current weather conditions
- **Location Services**: Automatic location detection or manual city search
- **Multiple Units**: Toggle between Celsius/Fahrenheit and metric/imperial units

### Extended Forecasts
- **7-Day Outlook**: Detailed daily forecasts with high/low temperatures
- **Hourly Predictions**: 24-hour hourly breakdown of weather conditions
- **Weather Alerts**: Severe weather warnings and notifications
- **Precipitation Maps**: Interactive radar and precipitation overlays

### Data Visualization
- **Temperature Trends**: Interactive charts showing temperature patterns
- **Precipitation Charts**: Visual representation of rainfall and snow data
- **Wind Direction**: Compass-style wind direction indicators
- **Pressure Graphs**: Atmospheric pressure trends over time

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies
**Pure JavaScript** with modern ES6+ features:
- Fetch API for data retrieval
- Async/await for handling API calls
- Local storage for user preferences
- Event-driven architecture

**HTML5 & CSS3** for structure and styling:
- Semantic HTML markup
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- CSS animations and transitions
- Responsive design principles

### API Integration
**OpenWeatherMap API** serves as the primary data source:
- Current weather data
- 5-day/3-hour forecasts
- Historical weather data
- Geocoding for location services

### Data Visualization
**Chart.js** powers the interactive charts:
- Line charts for temperature trends
- Bar charts for precipitation data
- Doughnut charts for weather condition distribution
- Responsive chart sizing

## User Interface Design

### Visual Design
